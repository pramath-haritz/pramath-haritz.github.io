*To whomsoever it may concern,*

Hi, I’m **Pramath**. If you’re reading this, I assume you want to know a bit more about me. So... let me give you a proper introduction. I was born on November 11th, 2002, and I’ve always been an extremely curious child. As a kid, I loved opening up RC cars and electronics; in fact, my dad had to keep the gadgets out of reach so I wouldn’t take them apart.

From a very early age, I was drawn to both **art and science**. I loved to draw and build things, and I like to believe those formative years shaped who I am today. I tend to think outside the box and enjoy experimenting with new ideas.

I like working for a cause, and **ChaksuAI** has become something very close to my heart. Contributing to the effort to cure preventable blindness is a mission I’m genuinely proud to be part of. I’m fortunate to have an incredible mentor, **Dr. Chandrashekhar Seelamanthula**, who has not only given me an opportunity but has also been a guiding light in both my personal and professional life.

**Coffee** has become a passionate obsession of mine since 2019. What began with my mother’s friend gifting us a batch brewer has evolved into a hobby centered on pursuing that elusive perfect cup. I love the scientific aspects of coffee and hope to write a few pieces here, sharing what I’ve learned and discovered along the way. I also hope to give this hobby a more formal presence through [project.maillard](https://instagram.com/project.maillard).

I also dabble in photography ([pramath.jpg](https://instagram.com/pramath.jpg)) and enjoy discussing philosophy. I hope to explore more of those thoughts here as well. Everything I write reflects my personal opinions, every human is free to exercise their agency. If you ever feel influenced, moved, or stirred by something I’ve written, I simply ask that you pause for a moment and question what you’ve just read.

Regards,  
**Pramath**
