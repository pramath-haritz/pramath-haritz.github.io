Hi, I’m Pramath.

I am a researcher with a deep fascination in art and science.

Currently, I work at Spectrum Lab, IISc Bangalore. My primary focus is ChaksuAI, a project close to my heart dedicated to curing preventable blindness through AI-powered vision care. I believe in technology that serves a cause, and I’m fortunate to be guided by Dr. Chandrashekhar Seelamanthula in this mission.

When I’m not coding or researching, you can find me obsessing over the science of the perfect cup of coffee. What started as a hobby has evolved into [project.maillard](https://instagram.com/project.maillard), where I explore the chemistry behind the brew.

I also explore photography and philosophy—viewing the world through a lens of skepticism and curiosity ([pramath.jpg](https://instagram.com/pramath.jpg)). I invite you to explore my work, read my thoughts, and question everything.
