Hi, I’m Pramath.

I am a researcher with a deep fascination for art and science.

Currently, I work at [Spectrum Lab](https://spectrum-lab-iisc.github.io/), IISc Bangalore. My primary focus is [ChaksuAI](https://chaksu.ai), a project close to my heart dedicated to curing preventable blindness through AI-powered last-mile care. I believe in technologies that serve a cause, and I’m fortunate to be guided by Dr. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula in this mission.

When I’m not coding or researching, you can find me obsessing over the science of the perfect cup of coffee. What started as a hobby has evolved into [project.maillard](https://instagram.com/project.maillard), where I explore the science behind the brew.

I also enjoy photography ([pramath.jpg](https://instagram.com/pramath.jpg)) and viewing the world through a lens of skepticism and curiosity. I invite you to explore my work, read my thoughts, and question everything.
