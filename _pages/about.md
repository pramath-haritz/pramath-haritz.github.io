![Illustration of EEG signal processing and NLP research](/images/eeg_nlp_research.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm an undergraduate student specializing in Electronics and Communication with a focus on Signal Processing at PES University, Bangalore.

🔬 My research interests lie in **Biomedical Signal Processing** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, particularly exploring ways to enhance diagnostic tools and understanding through these fields.

📚 I am currently working on innovative projects, such as detecting depression using EEG signals and extracting emotion-cause pairs with advanced neural network techniques.

# Selected Experience

## 🧠 Undergraduate Research Intern
During my time as a research intern at the Center for Robotics, Automation, and Intelligent Systems (cRAIS) at PES University, I applied machine learning to analyze EEG data to support CMD diagnosis, advancing psychological and psychiatric screening methods.

## 👨🏻‍🏫 Teaching Assistant
I am currently a Teaching Assistant for the "Artificial Neural Networks" elective at PES University, where I help develop and deliver course content, guide students in neural network projects, and provide tailored resources to support technical learning.

## 🤖 Hackathon Mentor
As a mentor for the SYNAPSE 2.0 National Level Hackathon, I provided participants with technical guidance, resolving complex issues, and ensuring project success by offering access to relevant resources and hands-on mentorship.

# Current Projects

### 🎓 Detection of Depression Through EEG Signals
- Developed a deep learning model using a Kolmogorov-Convolutional Neural Network (CKAN) architecture to detect depressive states from EEG data, enhancing accessibility to diagnostics in diverse regions.

### 🔍 Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction from Text
- Designed and implemented a Criss-Cross Attention mechanism for emotion-cause pair extraction, improving causal understanding in NLP applications and setting up a refined dataset for future research.
